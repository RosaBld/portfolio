# Portfolio App with Vite + React + Typescript + Tailwind

This project is a solo project to go deeper in React and Vite.JS but also to learn Typescript and Tailwind.

The goal of this project was to be able to create, completely solo, a side project, to get idea and to put them together.

It was also a great way to show some of the skills I learned during my classes and to put them together for a future internship

## What you'll find here

In this app you will find some of the work I realized, in solo or in group project, from Augustus 2023 to january 2024.

You will be able to navigate through the app and discover more about me, what I did and, if you are obviously interested, how to contact me for a future job.

### What was learned

- How to use Tailwind
- Display data with Typescript
- Navigate with react-router-dom
